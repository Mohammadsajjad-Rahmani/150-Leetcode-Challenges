# 150-LeetCode-Challenges

This repository tracks my journey of solving 150 LeetCode coding interview questions.  
The goal is not just to solve them, but to deeply understand patterns, algorithms, and improve problem-solving skills.

## 📌 What's included?

For each problem:
- ✅ solution approaches
- 🧠 Key insights, edge cases, and reasoning
- 📈 Time and space complexity analysis
- 💡 Mistakes or learning notes (if any)

## 🎯 Goal

Solve all 150 hand-picked LeetCode questions that are most common in interviews and improve:
- Understanding of core data structures & algorithms
- Problem-solving patterns
- Code clarity and efficiency

## 📁 Folder Structure 

Each question has its own folder named with the question number and title (e.g., `001-Merge-Sorted-Array`):

## ✅ Progress

| # | Title | Difficulty | Status | Notes |
|---|-------|------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Merge Sorted Array | Easy | ✅ Done | In-place merge using two pointers |
| 2 | Remove Element | Easy | ✅ Done | In-place removal of elements using two pointers. |
| 3 | Remove Duplicates From Sorted Array | Easy | ✅ Done | Two-pointer approach to overwrite duplicates while maintaining order. |
| 4 | Remove Duplicates From Sorted Array II | Medium | ✅ Done | In-place filtering with two pointers, allowing up to two duplicates |
| 5 | Majority Element | Easy | ✅ Done | Boyer-Moore Majority Vote algorithm for O(n) time and O(1) space. |
