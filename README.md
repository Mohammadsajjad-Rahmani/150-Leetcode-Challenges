# 150-LeetCode-Challenges

This repository tracks my journey of solving 150 LeetCode coding interview questions.  
The goal is not just to solve them, but to deeply understand patterns, algorithms, and improve problem-solving skills.

## 📌 What's included?

For each problem:
- ✅ solution approaches
- 🧠 Key insights, edge cases, and reasoning
- 📈 Time and space complexity analysis
- 💡 Mistakes or learning notes (if any)

## 🎯 Goal

Solve all 150 hand-picked LeetCode questions that are most common in interviews and improve:
- Understanding of core data structures & algorithms
- Problem-solving patterns
- Code clarity and efficiency

## 📁 Folder Structure 

Each question has its own folder named with the question number and title (e.g., `001-Merge-Sorted-Array`):
